## Setup Tools

Add the Network Security Policy (NSP) to your `tools` namespace to allow any builds to access the internet; they often need to do this to pull in resources like `npm` packages:

**Make sure you're in -tools**

```console
oc process -f openshift/templates/nsp-tools.yaml \
  -p NAMESPACE=$(oc project --short) | \
  oc create -f -
```

Next, create a service account that GitHub can use to run `oc` commands on the cluster. This service account has very limited access to trigger builds, list images, and create tags:

```console
oc process -f openshift/templates/cicd.yaml \
  -p NAMESPACE=$(oc project --short) | \
  oc create -f -
```

You should see a few secrets have been created (and a service account):

```console
➜  MOH-MSP-Enrolment git:(main) ✗ oc get secrets |grep github
github-cicd-dockercfg-pn4x6   kubernetes.io/dockercfg
github-cicd-token-c74j8       kubernetes.io/service-account-token
github-cicd-token-p69fn       kubernetes.io/service-account-token
```

Use one of the tokens (any one will work) and grab the token then base64 decode it. You'll paste this info into your repository's secrets on GitHub:

```console
oc get secret/github-cicd-token-hzq6t -o json | \
  jq '.data.token' | \
  tr -d "\"" | \
  base64 -d | \
  pbcopy
```

![Add Token as Secret](./add_token.gif)

Next, add the OCP4 URL as another git hub secret (you can find the url when you copy the logon command):

![Add URL as Secret](./add_ocp_url.gif)

**Pro Tip**: 

* The command above needs `jq` installed (`brew install jq`) and assumes your on macOS; `pbcopy` just copies the output to the clipboard so you can paste it.

* You probably need to grant permission for the image puller to pull images from your `*-tools` namespace. The following commands will do this; update the command and run them in each each of dev, test and prod.

```console
oc policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:f0463d-tools:default \
  -n $(oc project --short)
```

```console
oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:$(oc project --short):default \
  -n f0463d-tools
```

run in dev/test/prod:
```
oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:f0463d-dev:default --namespace=f0463d-tools
```

## `spa-env-server` Component

The following instructions are for the build and deployment of the `spa-env-server` component.

### Build

The GitHub Workflow (Actions) will use `oc` to trigger commands on-cluster. This workflow is located [here](../.github/workflows/spa-env-server.yml) in the `.github/workflows` folder of this project.

This workflow is setup to automatically run whenever files in these paths are changed:

```yaml
    paths:
      - "spa-env-server/src/**/*.js"
      - "spa-env-server/package*.json"
```

This workflow is triggered whenever files change in these paths for a PR or direct merge to the `main` branch. The workflow has several steps to run tests, build on node 10, node 10 and the final step is to build the images on OCP. This final step in the workflow `s2i-build` **only** runs when something is merged into the `main` branch.

When the entire workflow triggers, it will create a new image and automatically tag it with `dev` to trigger an image change deployment in your `dev` namespace.

Create the OCP image `BuildConfig` using the provided OCP template:

```console
oc process -f spa-env-server/openshift/templates/build.yaml | \
  oc create -f -
```
To build:

```start the build
oc start-build spa-env-server --follow
```


### Deploy

The `spa-env-server` component requires several parameters be supplied to the deployment template. These can be passed in with the `-p` flat in the `oc process` command, however, its easier to supply them as key-value pairs in file and pass the file to the `oc process` command.

Sample `params-dev.txt` file:

```text
FILE_LOG_LEVEL=info
MONITOR_PASSWORD=abc123
SERVICE_AUTH_TOKEN=afvffgfg
SOURCE_IMAGE_NAMESPACE=abc123xx-tools
SOURCE_IMAGE_TAG=dev
```

Then use the argument `--param-file=params-dev.txt` to pass these environment specific values to the `oc process` command to be applied to the template:

```console
oc process -f spa-env-server/openshift/templates/deploy.yaml \
  --param-file=params-dev.txt | \
  oc create -f -
```

**Pro Tip**: Add `params-*.txt` to .gitignore to make sure sensitive prod values are never stored in a repo.

## `msp` Component

The following instructions are for the build and deployment of the `msp` component. The build uses the on-cluster `nodejs:10` S2I image to run any scripts from `package.json` which require node. This step produces an artifacts image (msp-web-artifacts) that used as part of chained build. These artifacts are (from `npm run build`) are then consumed by the NGINX image which is pulled in from the RedHat Container Registry. This results in an image named `msp-web` that can be deployed.

The deployment mounts a `ConfigMap` containing the necessary NGINX config.

### Build

The GitHub Workflow (Actions) will use `oc` to trigger commands on-cluster. This workflow is located [here](../.github/workflows/msp.yml) in the `.github/workflows` folder of this project.

This workflow is setup to **automatically run** whenever files in these paths are changed:

```yaml
    paths:
      - "msp/src/**/*.html"
      - "msp/src/**/*.ts"
      - "msp/package*.json"
```

This workflow is triggered whenever files change in these paths for a PR or direct merge to the `main` branch. Also, for demonstration purposes, this workflow can be triggered manually.

The workflow has several steps to run: tests, build on node 10, node 10 and the final step is to build the images on OCP. This final step in the workflow `s2i-build` **only** runs when something is merged into the `main` branch.

When the entire workflow triggers, it will create a new image and automatically tag it with `dev` to trigger an image change deployment in the `dev` namespace.

Create the OCP image `BuildConfig` using the provided OCP template:

```console
oc process -f msp/openshift/templates/build.yaml | \
  oc create -f -
```

### Deploy

The deployment for the `msp` component is straight forward as it has little to no environment variables. The first step in the deploument is to create a `ConfigMap` with the necessary NGINX config:

```console
oc process -f msp/openshift/templates/config.yaml | \
  oc create -f -
```

Once created deploy the web application:

```console
oc process -f msp/openshift/templates/deploy.yaml \
  -p NAMESPACE=$(oc project --short) \
  -p SOURCE_IMAGE_NAMESPACE=f0463d-tools \
  -p SOURCE_IMAGE_TAG=dev | \
  oc create -f -
```

| Parameter              | Required | Description |
| :--------------------: | :------: | :---------- |
| NAMESPACE              | Y        | The namespace the component is being deployed to. |
| SOURCE_IMAGE_NAMESPACE | Y        | The namespace were the source image is located. |
| SOURCE_IMAGE_TAG       | Y        | The image tag that will trigger deployments |

## Additional Components

The work done on the `spa-env-server` component can be leveraged for the remanding components of this project. For example, to apply them to the `MyGovBC-MSP-Service` component the following steps will help:

1) Copy the `gulpfile.js` with the build tasks;
2) Install the packages with `npm -i -D NAME` that are located at the top of the gulpfile in the `require` lines.
3) Create a `src` directory and move required files like `index.js` into source (move any others that are needed).
4) Update the `build`, `start` and `dev` scripts in `package.json`.

At this point you should be able to run `npm run build` and have a `build` directory with the required files in it. This will be done by the node S2I image and it will look for a `build` directory for the source artifacts.

Next, create build and deploy templates for this new component:

1) Move your Jenkinsfile(s) aside they are no longer needed;
2) Copy over the `build.yaml` and `deploy.yaml` form the `spa-env-server`.
3) Update the `build.yaml` and `deploy.yaml` files as needed.

**NOTE**

In each `deploy.yaml` file there is a label `role: xxxx` this is used to identify each component in Aporeto. Its important that each deployment manifest / component get its own role so the NSP works properly.

The final step is to create a GitHub workflow:

1) Copy the file `spa-env-server.yml` in the `.github/workflows` directory to a new file representing the new component.
2) Update the paths and build names according to what you changed in `build.yaml`.
3) Consider adding a manual trigger for testing purposes.
